# pencil-sketch-converter
Created a Python-based project using OpenCV, transforming images into artistic pencil sketches by employing grayscale conversion, Gaussian blurring, edge detection, 
and adaptive thresholding. Successfully simulated hand-drawn effects with precise control, optimizing the pipeline for real-time transformation and enhanced sketch quality.
